## Technologies Used

- **Rust**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Yew**: A Rust framework for building front-end web applications using WebAssembly.
- **WebAssembly (WASM)**: Enables high-performance web applications.
- **web-sys**: Provides bindings to interact with browser APIs.
- **wasm-bindgen**: Facilitates communication between Rust and JavaScript.
- **Trunk**: A build tool for bundling and serving the Yew application.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Install Rust and Cargo via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Trunk**: Install Trunk, a WASM build tool, by running:
  ```bash
  cargo install trunk
  ```
- **WASM Target**: Add the WebAssembly target for Rust:
  ```bash
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```

### Running the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pocketjack-portfolio
   ```

2. **Build and Serve**:
   Use Trunk to build and serve the application locally:

   ```bash
   trunk serve
   ```

   This will start a local development server (typically at `http://localhost:8080`).

3. **Build for Production**:
   To create a production build:
   ```bash
   trunk build --release
   ```
   The output will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Usage

- Navigate through the sections using the browser.
- The **Projects** and **Client Projects** sections feature a carousel for browsing multiple items (auto-advances every 5 seconds, pauses on hover).
- The **Music** section includes embedded YouTube players for tracks and links to external platforms.
- The **Skills** section displays skills in a pyramid layout, with technical skills in a reverse pyramid and hobbies/languages in normal pyramids.
- The **Experience** section presents a timeline of professional roles.
